# Phinx: Simple PHP Database Migrations

Phinx makes it ridiculousy easy to manage the database migrations for your PHP app. In less than 5 minutes you can install Phinx using PEAR and create your first database migration. Phinx is only concerned with one thing and it does it bloody well.

### Phinx lets you

* Migrate up and down.
* Integrate with PHPUnit.
* Migrate on deployment.
* Get going in less than 5 minutes.
* Stop worrying about the state of your database.
* Write database agnostic PHP code.
* Run `phinx` and magically migrate(TM) to the latest schema.
* Take advantage of SCM features such as branching.

### Compared with other tools, Phinx _does notâ€¦_

* **Write log files.** The screen is better.
* **Try to do too much.** Migrations only.
* **Have unreadable source code.** We aim to be transparent.
* **Rely on a framework.** Phinx is independent. Use it with any app.
* **Support anything other than MySQL.** Feel free to fork and contribute if you desire.

### Install & Run

Mac OS X / Unix

1. `sudo pear channel-discover pear.phinx.org`
1. `sudo pear install phinx/phinx`
1. `cd myapp`

Goals
=====

 * Force developers to write migrations using PHP code rather than SQL code thereby making it database agnostic
 * Timestamps for migration files to prevent branching conflicts
 * Framework independent (don't rely on Zend_Db, Symfony etc)
 * Support migrating both up & down
 * Database Changelog table (allows databases to be copied and allows files to be changed on the file-system)
 * Installable via PEAR
 * Few dependencies
 * Support multiple databases
 * Integrate with PHPUnit (Easily create a Test database and empty it between each test)
 * Comprehensive documentation (coming soon)
 * Simple command-line operation (phinx )
     - phinx create CreateUserTable (writes the class CreateUserTable in the file XXXX_XX_XX_XXXXXX_create_user_table.php)
    - or just 'phinx' or 'phinx migrate' to automatically migrate the database
    - `phinx rollback` - Rollback the most recent migration
    - `phinx rollback -t 20110101` - date
    - 'phinx status' - prints the current db version
    - 'phinx version' - prints the version of phinx you are using
    - 'phinx help' - displays a list of commands
 * PHP 5.3 and above requirement
 * Low Barrier to Entry - Install via PEAR, Configure Your App and Migrate in Less Than 5 Minutes!
 * Integrates with build tools such as Phing
 * Full PHP docs (docblox)

Features
========

 * Migrate up & down
 * Integrate with PHPUnit (Create a Test Database)
 * Auto-migrations (Switch to branch 'x' and run migrations, but meanwhile branch 'y' has been modified)
     - This tool will automatically migrate down to the first available shared patch
    - then migrate up to the latest available patch
 * Text strings after timestamps in migration file names. e.g. '2012_01_03_151238_add_user_table.php'
 * Simple YAML-based configuration (uses Symfony YAML)
     - DB adapter type, host, port, db name, db user, db pass, supports both testing & production
    - Migration directory
    - Schema Database Name
    - set default DB
 * Only MySQL is supported for now
 * Produces a Schema Script (useful for unit tests)
 * Supports multiple databases for your application (prod, dev, test)
 
Outstanding Tasks
=================

 * up & down commands
 * init command
