### Phinx: Simple PHP Database Migrations

<a href="http://travis-ci.org/robmorgan/phinx"><img src="https://secure.travis-ci.org/robmorgan/phinx.png"/></a>

Phinx makes it ridiculousy easy to manage the database migrations for your PHP app. In less than 5 minutes you can install Phinx and create your first database migration. Phinx is just about migrations without all the bloat of a database ORM system or framework.

### Phinx lets you

* Migrate up and down.
* Integrate with PHPUnit.
* Migrate on deployment.
* Get going in less than 5 minutes.
* Stop worrying about the state of your database.
* Write database agnostic PHP code.
* Run `phinx` and magically migrate(TM) to the latest schema.
* Take advantage of SCM features such as branching.

### Compared with other tools, Phinx _does notâ€¦_

* **Write log files.** The screen is better.
* **Try to do too much.** Migrations only.
* **Have unreadable source code.** We aim to be transparent.
* **Rely on a framework.** Phinx is independent. Use it with any app.
* **Support anything other than MySQL.** Feel free to fork and contribute if you desire.

## Install & Run

The fastest way to install Phinx in your project is using Composer (http://getcomposer.org/).

1. Install composer:

```    
curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```
    
2. Add Phinx as a dependency to your `composer.json` file:

```js
{
    "require": {
        "robmorgan/phinx": "*"
    }
}
```
    
3. Install Phinx:
    
```
php composer.phar install
